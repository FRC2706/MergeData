### **Universal**
* We use Flutter, a framework compatible with most platforms, including iOS, Android, and in a web browser.
### **Google Sheets Integration**

## Description
MergeData is a modular FRC scouting app that is designed to be run on any device, including devices running iOS, Android, Windows, GNU/Linux, and macOS. Every season, a configuration file (JSON) gets created which allows the scouting questions to be easily changed to collect any data that is important for your team's scouting strategy. When done scouting, the data can be saved locally, scanned by other devices via a QR code, or uploaded to a Google Sheets spreadsheet.
